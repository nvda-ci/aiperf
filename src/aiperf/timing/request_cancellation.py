class RequestCancellationSimulator:
    """Probabilistic request cancellation simulator for testing client disconnections.

    Tests how inference servers handle client disconnections by sending complete
    requests and then disconnecting before receiving the full response. At credit
    issuance time, this simulator probabilistically decides whether a request should
    be cancelled and sets Credit.cancel_after_ns accordingly.

    Timing Flow:
        1. CreditIssuer calls next_cancellation_delay_ns() at credit issuance
        2. Delay (if any) is stored in Credit.cancel_after_ns
        3. Worker passes this to AioHttpClient via RequestInfo
        4. AioHttpClient starts the cancellation timer AFTER the request is
           fully sent (headers + body written to socket)
        5. If timer expires, request is cancelled and CreditReturn has
           error="RequestCancellationError"

        Timeline::

            T0: Credit issued (issued_at_ns captured for metrics)
                 │
                 │← Worker processing, connection acquired from pool
                 ▼
            T1: Start writing request to socket
                 │
                 │← HTTP headers + body transmitted
                 ▼
            T2: Request fully sent (timer starts here)
                 │
                 │← cancel_after_ns delay
                 ▼
            T3: Request cancelled if still waiting for response

        The timer starts at T2 ("request fully sent") to ensure the server always
        receives the complete request before disconnection. A delay of 0 means
        "send the full request, then immediately disconnect". Longer delays allow
        partial responses to be received before disconnection.

    Behavior:
        - Disabled during warmup to ensure consistency
        - Enabled during profiling based on configured cancellation rate
        - Uses derived RNG for reproducible patterns across runs

    Note:
        This is distinct from "credit cancellation" (CancelCredits message)
        which is used for clean shutdown on Ctrl+C or phase timeout.
