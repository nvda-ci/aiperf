What is the average (mean) of their side lengths?\n\nSolution: Since the areas of the three squares are 16, 49 and 169, then their side lengths are $\\sqrt{16}=4$, $\\sqrt{49}=7$ and $\\sqrt{169}=13$, respectively.\n\nThus, the average of their side lengths is $$\\frac{4+7+13}{3}=\\boxed{8}.$$\n\nProblem: Find all $x$ such that $\\lfloor \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor.$\n\nSolution: Observe that $\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor$ is an integer, so it follows that $\\lfloor \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1$. Also, $\\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 2$. Thus, our equation becomes $$\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 3.$$Let $n = \\lfloor x \\rfloor,$ so $n \\le x < n + 1.$\n\nIf $x < n + \\frac{1}{2},$ then $2n \\le x < 2n + 1,$ so $\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 2n,$ and\n\\[2n = n + 3,\\]which means $n = 3.$\n\nIf $x \\ge n + \\frac{1}{2},$ then $2n + 1 \\le x < 2n + 2,$ so $\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 2n + 1,$ and\n\\[2n + 1 = n + 3,\\]which means $n = 2.$\n\nTherefore, the set of solutions is $x \\in \\boxed{\\left[ \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{7}{2} \\right)}.$\n\nProblem: Sequence $A$ is a geometric sequence. Sequence $B$ is an arithmetic sequence.

What is the minimum number of boxes a participant needs to eliminate in order to have a half chance of holding at least $\\$100,\\!000$ as his or her chosen box?\n\nSolution: Seven of the boxes contain at least this amount. If a participant is going to be holding one of these boxes with a probability of $1/2,$ there can be at most $7$ other boxes left.

What is the average (mean) of their side lengths?\n\nSolution: Since the areas of the three squares are 16, 49 and 169, then their side lengths are $\\sqrt{16}=4$, $\\sqrt{49}=7$ and $\\sqrt{169}=13$, respectively.\n\nThus, the average of their side lengths is $$\\frac{4+7+13}{3}=\\boxed{8}.$$\n\nProblem: Find all $x$ such that $\\lfloor \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor.$\n\nSolution: Observe that $\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor$ is an integer, so it follows that $\\lfloor \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1$. Also, $\\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 2$. Thus, our equation becomes $$\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 3.$$Let $n = \\lfloor x \\rfloor,$ so $n \\le x < n + 1.$\n\nIf $x < n + \\frac{1}{2},$ then $2n \\le x < 2n + 1,$ so $\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 2n,$ and\n\\[2n = n + 3,\\]which means $n = 3.$\n\nIf $x \\ge n + \\frac{1}{2},$ then $2n + 1 \\le x < 2n + 2,$ so $\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 2n + 1,$ and\n\\[2n + 1 = n + 3,\\]which means $n = 2.$\n\nTherefore, the set of solutions is $x \\in \\boxed{\\left[ \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{7}{2} \\right)}.$\n\nProblem: Sequence $A$ is a geometric sequence. Sequence $B$ is an arithmetic sequence. Each sequence stops as soon as one of its terms is greater than $300.$ What is the least positive difference between a number selected from sequence $A$ and a number selected from sequence $B?$\n\n$\\bullet$ Sequence $A:$ $2,$ $4,$ $8,$ $16,$ $32,$ $\\ldots$\n\n$\\bullet$ Sequence $B:$ $20,$ $40,$ $60,$ $80,$ $100,$ $\\ldots$\n\nSolution: The terms of sequence $A$ are $2,$ $4,$ $8,$ $16,$ $32,$ $64,$ $128,$ $256,$ $512.$ The terms of sequence $B$ start from $20$ and go up by $20$ each time, so sequence $B$ is precisely all multiples of $20$ from $20$ to $320.$ We thus need to see which term in sequence $A$ is closest to a multiple of $20.$ $16,$ $64,$ and $256$ are the closest, each being $4$ away from a multiple of $20.$ So the least positive difference between a term in sequence $A$ and one in sequence $B$ is $\\boxed{4}.$\n\nProblem: In the game Deal or No Deal, participants choose a box at random from a set of $26,$ one containing each of the following values: \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\\hline\\$.01&\\$1,000\\\\\\hline\\$1&\\$5,000\\\\\\hline\\$5&\\$10,000\\\\\\hline\\$10&\\$25,000\\\\\\hline\\$25&\\$50,000\\\\\\hline\\$50&\\$75,000\\\\\\hline\\$75&\\$100,000\\\\\\hline\\$100&\\$200,000\\\\\\hline\\$200&\\$300,000\\\\\\hline\\$300&\\$400,000\\\\\\hline\\$400&\\$500,000\\\\\\hline\\$500&\\$750,000\\\\\\hline\\$750&\\$1,000,000\\\\\\hline\\end{tabular} After choosing a box, participants eliminate other boxes by opening them, showing the amount of money in the box to the crowd, and then removing that box (and its money!) from the game. What is the minimum number of boxes a participant needs to eliminate in order to have a half chance of holding at least $\\$100,\\!000$ as his or her chosen box?\n\nSolution: Seven of the boxes contain at least this amount. If a participant is going to be holding one of these boxes with a probability of $1/2,$ there can be at most $7$ other boxes left. This means that at least $26-7-7=\\boxed{12}$ boxes must be eliminated.\n\nProblem: Find the domain of the function $f(x) = \\tan(\\arccos(x^2)).$\n\nSolution: For $\\arccos (x^2)$ to be defined, we must have $-1 \\le x^2 \\le 1,$ which is satisfied only for $-1 \\le x \\le 1.$  Then $\\arccos (x^2)$ will always return an angle between 0 and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then $\\tan (\\arccos(x^2))$ is defined, unless $\\arccos(x^2) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  This occurs only when $x = 0.$\n\nTherefore, the domain of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-1,0) \\cup (0,1]}.$\n\nSolve the following math problem step by step. Put your final answer inside \\boxed{answer}.\n\nProblem: Simplify $\\sqrt{242}$.\n\nSolution:<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\n"
