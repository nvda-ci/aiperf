"""Tests for prefill concurrency control.

Prefill concurrency limits how many requests can be in the prefill (prompt-processing)
stage simultaneously. This is separate from the overall concurrency limit.

Validation approach:
- Use mock server with controlled TTFT (time to first token) to create measurable prefill phases
- Analyze exported JSONL records to verify prefill overlap doesn't exceed the limit
- Compare throughput/timing between different prefill_concurrency values
